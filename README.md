# Some notes on sra-tools usage
It is an outline of sra-tools usage routine. First, the copmpute (instance) is to have enough memory (16G? -- maybe, 8G) ana to have disk space to kepp raw data for at least one experiment. It coukd be 250Gish if we plan to work with fasta.

## Installation
Sra-tools as well the aligner or other tools are very convienient to be installed with conda. First, install conda itself.
